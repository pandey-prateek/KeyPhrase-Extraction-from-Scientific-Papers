## Instructions for the BiLSTM CRF models
1. Place the pretrained models in the respective folders.
2. Rename them to 'model.pth'
3. Run using python3 newimp_glove.py or python3 newimp_naive.py from the respective folders. (Note: only use either naive or glove model's .pth file at one time)
4. If pretrained model is not present it will start running the training.

## Instructions for running other files
1. Just run using python3 <filename.py>
